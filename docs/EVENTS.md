# Event Log Schema

The event log is the single contract of nightshift. Everything else — server, UI,
hooks, replay — is a producer or a pure consumer of this log.

- Storage: one JSON object per line (JSONL), append-only. Default location:
  `.nightshift/events.jsonl` in the project being observed.
- The UI state is `reduce(events[0..t])`. Live mode is `t = now`; replay is any
  earlier `t`. This only works if reducers are pure over the log, so:
- **Rule: external facts are recorded as events, never fetched at render time.**
  CI status, PR state, etc. enter the system as appended events. If the UI
  fetched them live, replay would show today's status in yesterday's session.

## Envelope

Every event has:

| field | type | meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `t`   | number | epoch milliseconds. Stamped by the producer; the server stamps it on `POST /event` if missing. |
| `type` | string | one of the types below |
| `item` | string? | optional work-item id this event belongs to |

Unknown event types must be ignored by consumers (forward compatibility).

## Types

### `session`
Session lifecycle. `{phase: "start" | "resume" | "attention" | "idle" | "end", title?, text?, session?, cwd?}`
- `start` opens the board clock; `resume` fires on each user prompt; `idle`
  means the agent finished a turn and is waiting for input; `end` closes the
  session. `start`/`resume` flip the badge to LIVE, `idle` to IDLE.
- `attention` (from Claude Code's `Notification` hook) means the agent is
  blocked on the human — permission prompt or a question. The board surfaces
  it loudly: red banner, badge, and tab title. It clears on `resume`/`idle`
  or on any subsequent tool activity (`edit`/`commit`), since activity means
  the request was answered.

### `item`
Work item upsert — the kanban cards. `{id, title?, status?, note?}`
- `status`: `inbox` → `doing` → `pr` → `done` (any transition is legal;
  `inbox` cards may also come from the UI or another human).
- Partial updates merge by `id`: `{type:"item", id:"wi-2", status:"pr"}` just
  moves the card.

### `todos`
Replaces the current fine-grained plan (the drill-in view on the active card).
`{todos: [{text, done}], item?}`

### `edit`
A file was touched. `{path, tool?}` — emitted by the PostToolUse hook for
Edit/Write tools. Feeds the activity column and per-item "warmth".

### `commit`
`{sha, message, add, del, files}` — emitted by the git `post-commit` hook with
numbers from `git diff --shortstat`. Drives the line counters and tickers.

### `pr`
`{number, title?, url?, state: "open" | "merged" | "closed"}`

### `ci`
`{status: "pending" | "pass" | "fail", pr?}`

### `note`
Free-form narration from the agent. `{text}` — used sparingly for milestones,
not a chat log.

## Attribution heuristic

Hooks usually don't know which work item an event belongs to. The reducer
attributes unattributed `edit`/`commit`/`todos`/`ci` events to the single item
currently in `doing`; if several are `doing`, to the most recently touched one;
if none, to session totals only. Producers that *do* know should set `item`
explicitly — explicit always wins.
